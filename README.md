MACROPAD FOR BLUEPRINT YAYAY- I created a macropad using 5 switches, 1 RP2040, and 2 LEDs. I followed the tutorial to a T and simply added an extra switch, but this is version 1 of hopefully more versions to come!

## Challenges
This was my first time using KiCAD, and wiring the PCB was a pain. I had to redo it around seven times because I kept missing one route. This is my very first Hackpad, I'm planning to make more complex ones in the future :)

- 2x SK6812 MINI Leds
- 1x XIAO RP2040
